### 1. Background
As graduation approaches for me, I decided that it would be beneficial to get an overview of the Data centered jobs in Singapore. Therefore, I decided to web scrap the popular job site, Glassdoor, to gather data on the jobs on the market and have the bigger picture of the job market.

### 3. Data Scraping Approach
I chose Glassdoor as the website to attain my data due to the depth and breadth of companies posted. The anonymity nature of Glassdoor further compelled me to use this website to attain job information as it would mean that the information is less skewed towards any party.
<br> Unfortuantely, Glassdoor do not have any public API avaiable, therefore we needed to scrap the data to collect the information on the postings on the site. I utilised selenium package within Python to scrap the website as Glassdoor renders it webpage with Javascript instead of HTML, therefore, we needed the user input function selenium has to offer.
