189,#SGUNITEDJOBS GLOBAL DATA ANALYST,"Position Purpose & Summary:
The volume of analytical data that our businesses and analysts are generating is increasing significantly, as is the breadth and frequency with which public data and market data is made available. Proprietary data streams exist in disparate sources, hindering the analytics process.

Although the business unit has started to adopt best practices regarding centralised, integrated, scalable data systems and analytical tools, we teams are still learning how to leverage these capabilities for both familiar and new trading opportunities. This situation creates data loss concerns as well as makes it very difficult for others in the department to utilise that data. The ramifications are especially important in regions such as Asia-Pacific where relatively small or reduced physical footprint heightens Cargill’s the need for competitive data and trading analytics, but centralised data infrastructure and process are relatively new.

The ideal candidate will need to understand how data adds value to our analysts and our trading teams, be able to engage our offices around the world to find that data and demonstrate the value of it. The candidate will work with the Trading Analytics Technology Team (TAT) to harvest, secure, and share the data, and understand how to leverage it with a common set of integrated tools.

40% - Key Project Identification and Management:
Partner with Asia-Pacific & Global Trading Data and Analytics Leadership to identify highest value trading opportunities which can be solved by extending or developing our core data and analytics capabilities in APAC.
Ensure the organisation, execution, and delivery of these projects.
Collaborate with the Data & Modelling team and TAT to provide solutions with scalable / integrated data systems and processes and focus on continuous improvement of analytical tools.
Serve as the data Subject Matter Expert on special projects / initiatives.

15% - User Interface Development / Support:
Train global teams especially those in Asia Pacific on how to design and manage BI tool interfaces (Tableau, Power BI) where data and analysis can be effectively communicated to customers.
Serve as co-administrator for the business unit BI sites, maintaining site organisation, managing site users, and overseeing site performance and data sources.
Train end-users to consume dashboards and analyse via Cargill’s Tableau and Power BI web portals.
Attend BI conferences and participate in internal user group forums and on-going web trainings.
