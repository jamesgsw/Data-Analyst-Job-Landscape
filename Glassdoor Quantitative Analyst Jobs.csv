We are looking for a motivated and passionate Commodities Analyst with finance background in deal structuring and is skilled in financial modeling with stakeholder management capability.

Where you fit in

This role is for a Commodities Analyst within Shell Energy Europe & Environmental Products (SE-EE).

The Deal Structuring team in SE-EE is a commercial function accountable for the valuation and risk assessment of new complex contracts and takes ownership of the valuation and deal management methodology. The team (currently 10 Deal Structurers and 2 Team Leads) operates from the Shell trading hub in London where the majority of the team members are located with some individual ones located in the local sales offices in continental Europe.

The main activity of the Deal Structuring team is close collaboration with Originators and Trading desks to develop deal opportunities that add value and to support growth of the portfolio within the Energy product space in Power & Gas in Europe and for Environmental Products across the globe.

The main commercial stakeholders for the Deal Structuring team are the Power and Gas Businesses in Europe and the Environmental Product Trading Business (EPTB) that operates globally with desks in London, Singapore, San Diego and Shanghai.

To support the growing activities of EPTB in Asia and Oceania, specifically to give local support to the EPTB desks in Singapore and Shanghai, the Deal Structuring team expands its presence to the Shell Trading Hub in Singapore.
What’s the role?

We are therefore looking for a senior individual who combines the quantitative and analytical skillset of a Commodities Analyst with a commercial mindset and the ability to manage a complex stakeholder environment across multiple locations. While the role reports into the team lead in London, working on a different time zone, the candidate is expected to show a high degree of independence to manage the requirements for the EPTB desks locally in Singapore and Shanghai and balance it with full integration into the Deal Structuring team in London.

The role needs the necessary experience and self-dependence to quickly build a strong relationship with the EPTB business in Singapore and Shanghai and increase and supervise the local Deal Structuring activity. EPTB works in fast-changing and illiquid markets and continuously needs to adapt. The role therefore requires an agile, creative mind and strong work ethic to keep pace with the market developments.

We expect the candidate to travel to Shanghai and on occasion to accompany the EPTB originators for external meetings with customers in the area. It will also be required to travel to London regularly to keep in touch with the colleagues in the team.

Accountabilities for the role:
The main responsibility of the role is to collaborate with the EPTB desks in the area and support the growth of the EPTB portfolio, while being accountable for the methodology of the valuation and risk assessment of complex transactions.

The role needs to:
Represent the Deal Structuring team in Singapore and build strong relationships with the local stakeholders in EPTB and internal functional departments (Risk, Finance, Credit)
Collaborate with EPTB originators and traders to create innovative structured products in response to demand and changing market conditions
Keep close connection with the Deal Structuring team in London and ensure a common aligned approach
Provide an independent view on structured transactions, with constructive challenge of the deal owner as required and suggest alternative solutions or improvements
Develop and own valuation methods and models for pricing and risk assessment of complex structured contracts. Identify value drivers and risks inherent in the transactions (e.g. market risk, project risk, credit risk, regulatory risk, financing risk).
As part of the deal team proactively engage with commercial project leaders to (re-)structure non-standard transactions during negotiation phase, be creative to suggest alternative solutions and adaption of contract structures
Work closely with all relevant internal stakeholders during the approval process
Collaborate with deal owners to manage and extract value from acquired structured positions
Maintain close, collaborative relationships with the wider EPTB team and other internal partners in the value chain such as New Energies / Nature Based Solutions (NBS)
Maintain an outward mindset and ongoing commitment of Deal Structuring to the One-team approach

We also develop the Smart Nation infrastructure and applications, and facilitate collaboration with citizens and businesses to co-develop technologies.

GovTech's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence team uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore. We build software for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.

Data scientists in GovTech help crack challenging problems through the use of machine learning and other computational methods on government data. You would have the opportunity to work across domains like citizen engagement, healthcare, transport and operations.

Join us as we support Singapore’s vision of building a Smart Nation - a nation of possibilities empowered through info-communications technology and related engineering.

What to Expect:

As a data scientist, you will help to:
Improve public service delivery and policy by extracting insights from government data
Work closely with product managers, data scientists and engineers to develop, test and deploy new data products
Write production-quality code and work with engineers to put models into operation
Learn new things and impart knowledge with other team members in a multi-disciplinary team
Additionally, more senior data scientists will be expected to establish best practices, share your expertise and mentor other data scientists and help with recruiting.

This job entails bringing your expertise and capability to the public sector -- from coding new systems from scratch to using the best solutions the community has to offer. We use cloud services, open source software, and commodity hardware as far as possible. Knowing what to build and what to reuse lets us avoid wasting time on solved problems and focus on delivering actual value.

In GovTech, there will be opportunities to work on meaningful projects that solve problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people’s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government. If hired, expect the following:
Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.
Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having opinions on what is being done and having ideas on what should be done next. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.
Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.
How to Succeed:
Applicants that are well-versed in Python, JavaScript and Scala will be appreciated but it is not mandatory. Proficiency in at least one language and the ability to learn is what matters to us.

We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government. If hired, expect the following:

Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.

Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having opinions on what is being done and having ideas on what should be done next. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.
