E-commerce Business Analyst
Job Description


The Role

You will be part of the APAC E-Commerce Regional team, a team that supports the Personal Health country teams in APAC in advancing key E-Commerce capabilities. Personal Health is Philips Consumer business.

E-Commerce is a rapidly growing channel and a strategic priority for our business. The E-commerce team is young, fast-moving and fun-loving, with an entrepreneurial and high performance mindset.

Your Key Areas of Responsibility

The initial focus is to streamline and extract maximum value (insights) from our growing sets of Ecommerce data. If successful, your data landscape and responsibility will increase to cover all BI data for the Philips Personal Health business in APAC to create an integrated daily management ‘cockpit’, and lastly to further integrate 3rd party Ecommerce platforms’ data with Philips Digital and Campaign data.

Your job will be to drive the following domains:

Data infrastructure, dashboards & reporting
Integrate multiple 1st and 3rd party data sources (excels, powerpivots, SQL databases, etc) into a structured dataset with (automated) dashboards, liaising closely with our online retail partners, Philips country ecommerce & marketing managers to ensure consistency, accuracy & relevancy
Our dataset is quite complex and data needs to be cleansed / aligned periodically to enable proper reporting and analysis
Own monthly online sales and performance reporting, KPI & target tracking with the objective to automate reporting as much as possible
Develop a channel view in financial reporting, leading to a full BI solution and Daily Management board with key business performance indicators
Analytics & insights
Manage and analyze reports for Philips own brand eShop and drive platform-specific insights to grow our business,
Analyze the overall online channel data to track business performance, translate data to insights and flag issues / optimization opportunities
Generate insights on consumer demographics, behaviours and patterns, correlations etc for targeting purposes.
Run performance analysis on the following domains: Portfolio, Operations, Financial, On-site (in-store excellence), Campaigns, Market share, etc on a recurring basis, with occasional Deep dive studies on performance issues / growth opportunities in all domains
Deliver category and campaign specific insights and improvement recommendations to category marketing managers and ecommerce managers
Challenges of the job
Philips is a large company with many stakeholders and you need to find your way in order to make the most impact. You are the master of your own destiny (with support of course), but this is not something that everyone is comfortable with.
Besides being an analytical rockstar, you will be expected to learn to understand our business. Data is more than a set of datapoints and you need to understand the business story the numbers tell.
The audience for your insights spans a wide range of functions (marketing, management, ecommerce, finance, digital) which all have different insight requirements, and a wide range of data proficiency (mature to developing countries & teams). Your dashboards and tools therefore need to be granular enough for advanced users and intuitive enough for less proficient users.
Data is coming from many different sources and systems, and different channels report in different formats, with varying degrees of data quality. Extensive data checking, mapping, cleansing and structuring will be required (but you won’t start from scratch).
The ideal candidate would have:
Ability to set up a data warehouse / databases and automated reporting & dashboards, drawing from multiple data sources
Advanced Microsoft excel (VBA, power pivots) skills, experience with PowerBI / QlikSense and database/dataset structuring & manipulation abilities
Analytical thinking ability and a well-developed business understanding and commercial sense to identify opportunities and grow the business
Ability to prepare and give presentations on regional/national management level.
Fluency in English, verbally and in writing.
Typically, a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree with at least 3-5 years of related experience.
E-Commerce experience, either from brand principal, distributor or e-commerce platform
Ability to work independently, able to envision the big picture but executing with attention for detail with strong communication skills and a (fun) team player mentality
Why should you join Philips?

Working at Philips is more than a job. It’s a calling to create a healthier society through meaningful work, focused on improving 3 billion lives a year by delivering innovative solutions across the health continuum. Our people experience a variety of unexpected moments when their lives and careers come together in meaningful ways.

241,Software Developer - Senior / Lead Consultant,"How would you make your mark if you knew you could influence beyond your current projects?

How would you leverage your technical expertise to create extraordinary impact for our clients?

ThoughtWorks is a global software consultancy with an aim to create a positive impact on the world through technology. Our community of technologists thinks disruptively to deliver pragmatic solutions for our clients' most complex challenges. We are curious minds who come together as collaborative and inclusive teams to push boundaries, free to be ourselves and make our mark in tech.

Our developers have been contributing code to major organizations and open source projects for over 25 years. They've also been writing books, speaking at conferences and helping push software development forward, changing companies and even industries along the way.

As consultants, we work onsite with our clients to ensure we're evolving their technology and empowering adaptive mindsets to meet their business goals. You could influence the digital strategy of a retail giant, build a bold new mobile application for a bank or redesign platforms using event sourcing and intelligent data pipelines. You will use the latest Lean and Agile thinking, create pragmatic solutions to solve mission-critical problems and challenge yourself every day.

Lead Consultant Developers act as the primary point of contact for our clients, ensuring that teams are successful in their delivery. As a Lead Consultant Developer, you will bring a strategic mindset to projects and spend time negotiating with clients in order to bring a technical vision to life. Having a balance of high-level and tactical mindsets is a must, as you will spend time both with clients and alongside your fellow teammates.

For a team to thrive, it needs active collaboration and room for healthy, respectful debate. Senior Developers are the technologists who cultivate this environment while driving teams toward delivering on an ambitious tech vision and acting as mentors for more junior-level consultants. They leverage their deep technical knowledge to solve more complex business problems and actively assess their team's health, code quality and nonfunctional pipelines.

Examples of some of our current/recent projects:
High-priority national Smart Nation projects with the Singapore Government developed in native/hybrid Android and iOS & other web technologies
Working with Micro-frontends and Event Driven Architecture with our banking clients (GraphQL, Kafka, Kotlin, ReactJS etc.)
Replatforming existing systems to a microservices approach and building custom applications, while consulting our clients on their vision and product strategy.
You'll spend time on the following:
You will lead or take part in the entire cycle of software consulting and delivery from ideation to deployment and everything in between
You will act as a mentor for less-experienced peers through both your technical knowledge and leadership skills
You will design solutions and choose technologies that solve clients' problems while staying within constraints
You will use continuous delivery practices to deliver high-quality software as well as value to end customers as early as possible.
You will work in collaborative, value-driven teams to build innovative customer experiences for our clients
Create large-scale distributed systems out of microservices
Efficiently utilize DevOps tools and practices to build and deploy software
Utilize the latest technology thinking from our tech radar in your work
Apply a variety of languages to your work and continue to code alongside Developers; you will never go post-technical in this role
Here's what we're looking for:
You have professional experience with expert-level knowledge of two or more languages (C#, Ruby, Java, Javascript, etc.) as well as comfortability with the latest Object-Oriented technology (At least 6 for Senior Consultants, at least 8 for Lead Consultants)
You have led software development teams using Agile, Lean and/or Continuous Delivery approaches such as TDD, continuous integration, pairing, and infrastructure automation - We utilise Extreme Programming (XP)
You can skilfully write high-quality, well-tested code and you are comfortable with Object-Oriented programming
You have experience influencing others and always advocate for technical excellence while being open to change when needed
Presence in the external tech community: you proactively share your expertise with others via speaking engagements, contributions to open source, blogs and more
The ability to develop and execute a technical vision with a focus on business value
You're willing and able to commit to travel to client sites in order to solve their business problems
You're resilient in ambiguous situations and can approach challenges from multiple perspectives
We would love if you're up to speed on functional programming paradigms and languages like Clojure, Scala, etc.
Bonus points if you have knowledge of cloud technology such as AWS, Docker or Kubernetes

About Us


Boston Consulting Group partners with leaders in business and society to tackle their most important challenges and capture their greatest opportunities. BCG was the pioneer in business strategy when it was founded in 1963. Today, we help clients with total transformation-inspiring complex change, enabling organizations to grow, building competitive advantage, and driving bottom-line impact.

To succeed, organizations must blend digital and human capabilities. Our diverse, global teams bring deep industry and functional expertise and a range of perspectives to spark change. BCG delivers solutions through leading-edge management consulting along with technology and design, corporate and digital ventures—and business purpose. We work in a uniquely collaborative model across the firm and throughout all levels of the client organization, generating results that allow our clients to thrive.

Practice Area Profile

The Global Advantage is one of BCG's core functional practice areas with a unique commercial offering and a long tradition of cutting-edge thought leadership. Being at the crossroads of emerging and mature markets, we work with our clients to unlock unparalleled business opportunities offered by globalization while mastering the challenges of disruption. We help clients not only build sizable international footprints but also maximize their potential in the face of global disruptive forces such as rapidly changing markets, geopolitical environment, rising local competitors as well as shifting customer behavior and preferences. In our daily work, we enable our clients to transform their organization in order to win globally.

Role Profile

The Boston Consulting Group

The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) is a global management consulting firm and the world's leading advisor on business strategy. We partner with clients from the private, public, and not-for-profit sectors in all regions to identify their highest-value opportunities, address their most critical challenges, and transform their enterprises. Our customised approach combines deep insight into the dynamics of companies and markets with close collaboration at all levels of the client organisation. This ensures that our clients achieve sustainable competitive advantage, build more capable organisations, and secure lasting results. Founded in 1963, BCG is a private company with more than 90 offices in 50 countries.

Global Advantage

Unlocking growth in emerging markets is a big piece of the globalization puzzle. One of the biggest levers companies have that can dramatically change their position in the market is developing a stellar go-to-market approach. The sheer magnitude of the opportunity and dynamism at play in emerging markets means a one-size-fits-all approach is not adequate. Companies need to take a de-averaged approach in their go-to-market activities. Getting it right is a major source of competitive advantage. Building best-in-class go-to-market strategies requires a concerted and systematic effort given the challenges on the ground.

Expert Career Track (ECT)

Expertise is of vital importance to BCG and our clients. Our clients expect BCG to help tailor solutions to their specific needs. Increasingly, clients expect us to bring deep industry and functional expertise to the table. Our continued investments in knowledge and expertise have been a critically important driver of our success. The growth and development of the ECT cohort is a core component of these investments.

The ECT cohort is a valuable complement to the generalist track, and helps BCG to provide expertise depth that our generalist track does not cover or ordinarily develop. The Track enables individuals to bring significant value to BCG with significant operational or technical experience in a specific field, usually gained outside of BCG either in industry, academia or specialised consulting.

Coda Payments (https://www.codapay.com/) helps Google, Tencent, and other leading digital content providers monetise their products in places where credit and debit cards aren’t widely used. We establish partnerships with a wide range of alternative payment channel operators who make it possible for customers to pay in other ways: paying cash at retail, using a mobile wallet, making a bank transfer, or redeeming a prepaid card.

Coda helps publishers to accept payments through these various methods on their own website or app, or on our gaming e-commerce site - codashop.com.

What it is like to be in our team

Life at Coda is fast-paced: our instinct is to bite off a bit more than we can chew, so we’re always busy. As a rapidly growing startup, we’re always ready to keep up and adapt to changes quickly; when we go fast, we have shorter time to react.

We’re always impatient and we don’t wait for things to happen; we hustle to make them happen. If you’re someone who is tired of waiting for your ideas to be heard; someone who is hungry to contribute more; someone who derives more satisfaction from team wins rather than from individuals ones; and someone who values integrity rather than cutting corners - you will fit perfectly into the Coda team!

Responsibilities

Working as part of Coda's Product Management team, you will drive various initiatives that help in maximizing our marketing efforts.
Owning the completion and distribution of monthly reporting deliverables for marketing functions and identification of opportunities to improve digital marketing campaigns
Synthesize complex data sets into actionable insights and builds analytics stories that culminate in accurate business decisions
Implement effective visualization techniques for complex concepts visualizing “big data” use cases
