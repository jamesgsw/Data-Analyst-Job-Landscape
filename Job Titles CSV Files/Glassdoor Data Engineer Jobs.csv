The ideal candidate would be someone with onsite B2B experience while dealing with enterprise technology deployment. They should be able to liaise with internal technology teams and work in a multi-stakeholder environment.

A Senior Data Engineer's responsibility is to implement and deploy data analysis pipelines at various clients of Lynx Analytics and also support and overlook the work of other Lynx Analytics data engineers. This includes participating in and supervising the activities below:

Understand deeply the business problem we are trying to solve by our analytical solution
Through continuous consultations with employees of our client, discover the client's existing data sources that are relevant to the problem we try to solve. This includes discussions with client IT, data owners, future business users, etc. At the end of this activity, the data engineer should have a good understanding of all relevant data sources, their schemas, semantics and physical locations and interconnections among different sources.
Working together with the IT teams of the client, define the technical architecture for the analytical solution that we are to deploy for the client. This includes figuring out which IT components will be needed, where each of them will get installed (e.g. cloud, client's own IT infrastructure), how they will connect to each other, who will be responsible for which component, etc. This also includes sizing and figuring out the necessary capacity for the various components, e.g. defining computer hardware specs and cluster sizes
Implement the data ingestion subsystem: this is the system responsible for moving all the necessary data sources to a single location where the actual analysis will happen. This is a challenging task as all clients uses different database and data storage technologies and hence the ingestion system is always very different at different clients
Implement the data analysis pipelines. This needs close collaboration with data scientists who oversee the data analysis and modeling techniques to solve the business challenge. Once the data science problem is solved, the data engineers turn the methodology into a reliable, automated, production pipeline. This typically includes creating new processing streams in python and proprietary Lynx data processing APIs as well as reusing components from Lynx's repository of pipeline components
Integrate the results into business UIs developed by Lynx or pre-existing client software systems.

Implement the data ingestion subsystem: this is the system responsible for moving all the necessary data sources to a single location where the actual analysis will happen. This is a challenging task as all clients uses different database and data storage technologies and hence the ingestion system is always very different at different clients

Implement the data analysis pipelines. This needs close collaboration with data scientists who oversee the data analysis and modeling techniques to solve the business challenge. Once the data science problem is solved, the data engineers turn the methodology into a reliable, automated, production pipeline. This typically includes creating new processing streams in python and proprietary Lynx dataprocessing APIs as well as reusing components from Lynx's repository of pipeline components

Integrate the results into business UIs developed by Lynx or pre-existing client software systems.

A Senior Data Engineer's responsibility is to implement and deploy data analysis pipelines at various clients of Lynx Analytics and also support and overlook the work of other Lynx Analytics data engineers. This includes participating in and supervising the activities below:

Understand deeply the business problem we are trying to solve by our analytical solution
Through continuous consultations with employees of our client, discover the client's existing data sources that are relevant to the problem we try to solve. This includes discussions with client IT, data owners, future business users, etc. At the end of this activity, the data engineer should have a good understanding of all relevant data sources, their schemas, semantics and physical locations and interconnections among different sources.
Working together with the IT teams of the client, define the technical architecture for the analytical solution that we are to deploy for the client.

Thunes mission is to unlock opportunities for Emerging Markets. We interconnect mobile wallet operators, corporates, merchants, money transfer operators, payment service providers and banks to unlock opportunities for businesses and individuals alike to participate in the global economy.

Corporate mass payouts

About SWAT

SWAT is building next generation urban mobility solutions for the future smart cities of the world. Working with the government and public transport operators, we are reimagining how people move in the future.

We started by building a simulation engine and used real commute data from the government to analyze how factors like operating efficiency and service levels are affected by different input parameters. Next, we replaced simulated vehicles and passengers with mobile apps that translated simulation results into thousands of actual rides and paying customers. Along the way we have learnt a lot from our users and accumulated invaluable knowledge in this space.

If you like solving problems in the mobility space and are looking to join a great team with a great vision, we would like to chat with you!

Quote from Second Minister Ng Chee Meng:

""We also have SWAT, a local start-up that aims to provide on-demand bus services. The company uses a routing algorithm to pick up and drop off passengers on demand, while dynamically optimising the route in real-time so that the bus has the most efficient route in managing fares and passengers. This could potentially transform how bus services are operated in the future, including public bus services in areas where there is lower ridership, and maybe during low-demand hours.""",5.0,"SWAT Mobility Pte.

You are not just here to write code, but also to figure out what we should be building and how we should build it.

The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people’s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.

Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.
Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having opinions on what is being done and having ideas on what should be done next. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.
Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.
