The Planning & Analysis team’s role is to provide data-driven analysis and insight to help BIMA to grow sustainably and profitably.

We are looking for a Reporting Analyst to design, build and deploy a scalable, consistent, integrated and leading-edge Business Intelligence ecosystem that will enable BIMA to make better and more reliable data-driven decisions around how we can best serve our customers and grow our business in a sustainable and profitable way. The role will be focused exclusively on building and developing our BI ecosystem, with ongoing ETL and maintenance support activities in collaboration with our team of BI architects in Bangalore.

Initially, this will involve creating different centralized KPI tables from our main customer database to connect them using Microsoft Excel and Tableau to enable country managers and global and regional functions to self-serve our core customer and revenue data without coding or analyst support.

Beyond this initial development, which utilizes the existing Microsoft BI stack we then want to begin integrating our core revenue and customer data with additional data sources from dialer systems (for sales and customer services), lead generation partners (typically customer data received from mobile phone networks), insurance claims data (Salesforce being implemented), finance and HR systems (Workday being implemented), customer satisfaction data and mHealth app and tele-doctor consultation usage data. Historically the business has underinvested in systems, but we are now on a big investment drive to put in place new systems that will help us to scale over the long-term.

This role is an opportunity for a Reporting Analyst to really put their stamp on BIMA’s BI ecosystem and to help decide on and implement the best tools, processes and systems that will enable us to efficiently organize our data to help provide meaningful insights that will better serve our customers.

RESPONSIBILITIES
Work with business teams to understand, prioritize and deliver requirements
Design and deliver technical architecture and code for BIMA’s BI ecosystem to enable effective reporting and analytics and self-service by end-users
Identify BI improvements and potential new systems, tools and processes
Design and deliver automated reporting and dashboards as required

367,Reporting Analyst,"Roles & Responsibilities

The Planning & Analysis team’s role is to provide data-driven analysis and insight to help BIMA to grow sustainably and profitably.

We are looking for a Reporting Analyst to design, build and deploy a scalable, consistent, integrated and leading-edge Business Intelligence ecosystem that will enable BIMA to make better and more reliable data-driven decisions around how we can best serve our customers and grow our business in a sustainable and profitable way. The role will be focused exclusively on building and developing our BI ecosystem, with ongoing ETL and maintenance support activities in collaboration with our team of BI architects in Bangalore.

Initially, this will involve creating different centralized KPI tables from our main customer database to connect them using Microsoft Excel and Tableau to enable country managers and global and regional functions to self-serve our core customer and revenue data without coding or analyst support.

Beyond this initial development, which utilizes the existing Microsoft BI stack we then want to begin integrating our core revenue and customer data with additional data sources from dialer systems (for sales and customer services), lead generation partners (typically customer data received from mobile phone networks), insurance claims data (Salesforce being implemented), finance and HR systems (Workday being implemented), customer satisfaction data and mHealth app and tele-doctor consultation usage data. Historically the business has underinvested in systems, but we are now on a big investment drive to put in place new systems that will help us to scale over the long-term.

This role is an opportunity for a Reporting Analyst to really put their stamp on BIMA’s BI ecosystem and to help decide on and implement the best tools, processes and systems that will enable us to efficiently organize our data to help provide meaningful insights that will better serve our customers.

RESPONSIBILITIES
Work with business teams to understand, prioritize and deliver requirements
Design and deliver technical architecture and code for BIMA’s BI ecosystem to enable effective reporting and analytics and self-service by end-users
Identify BI improvements and potential new systems, tools and processes
Design and deliver automated reporting and dashboards as required

Job Description


The Role

You will be part of the APAC E-Commerce Regional team, a team that supports the Personal Health country teams in APAC in advancing key E-Commerce capabilities. Personal Health is Philips Consumer business.

E-Commerce is a rapidly growing channel and a strategic priority for our business. The E-commerce team is young, fast-moving and fun-loving, with an entrepreneurial and high performance mindset.

Your Key Areas of Responsibility

The initial focus is to streamline and extract maximum value (insights) from our growing sets of Ecommerce data. If successful, your data landscape and responsibility will increase to cover all BI data for the Philips Personal Health business in APAC to create an integrated daily management ‘cockpit’, and lastly to further integrate 3rd party Ecommerce platforms’ data with Philips Digital and Campaign data.

Your job will be to drive the following domains:

Data infrastructure, dashboards & reporting
Integrate multiple 1st and 3rd party data sources (excels, powerpivots, SQL databases, etc) into a structured dataset with (automated) dashboards, liaising closely with our online retail partners, Philips country ecommerce & marketing managers to ensure consistency, accuracy & relevancy
Our dataset is quite complex and data needs to be cleansed / aligned periodically to enable proper reporting and analysis
Own monthly online sales and performance reporting, KPI & target tracking with the objective to automate reporting as much as possible
Develop a channel view in financial reporting, leading to a full BI solution and Daily Management board with key business performance indicators
Analytics & insights

Challenges of the job
Philips is a large company with many stakeholders and you need to find your way in order to make the most impact. You are the master of your own destiny (with support of course), but this is not something that everyone is comfortable with.
Besides being an analytical rockstar, you will be expected to learn to understand our business. Data is more than a set of datapoints and you need to understand the business story the numbers tell.
The audience for your insights spans a wide range of functions (marketing, management, ecommerce, finance, digital) which all have different insight requirements, and a wide range of data proficiency (mature to developing countries & teams). Your dashboards and tools therefore need to be granular enough for advanced users and intuitive enough for less proficient users.
Data is coming from many different sources and systems, and different channels report in different formats, with varying degrees of data quality. Extensive data checking, mapping, cleansing and structuring will be required (but you won’t start from scratch).
The ideal candidate would have:
Ability to set up a data warehouse / databases and automated reporting & dashboards, drawing from multiple data sources
Advanced Microsoft excel (VBA, power pivots) skills, experience with PowerBI / QlikSense and database/dataset structuring & manipulation abilities
Analytical thinking ability and a well-developed business understanding and commercial sense to identify opportunities and grow the business
Ability to prepare and give presentations on regional/national management level.
Fluency in English, verbally and in writing.
Typically, a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree with at least 3-5 years of related experience.
E-Commerce experience, either from brand principal, distributor or e-commerce platform
Ability to work independently, able to envision the big picture but executing with attention for detail with strong communication skills and a (fun) team player mentality

Working at Philips is more than a job. It’s a calling to create a healthier society through meaningful work, focused on improving 3 billion lives a year by delivering innovative solutions across the health continuum. Our people experience a variety of unexpected moments when their lives and careers come together in meaningful ways.

At SSON Analytics, we believe that data science is just the first step of the analytics journey, and that coupling a great data scientist with a great Research Analyst is the key to creating real and valuable business insights.

We consider our Research Analysts as investigative journalists armed with factual evidence. They piece together the data puzzle, draw out industry insights that tell the real story, then translate the critical headlines to the SSON community. These visual analytics reports present the facts neutrally, both on where the market trends currently sit, and where they are most probably headed (based purely upon data results from indexes and scientific formulae).

This is a fantastic opportunity to be exposed to the exciting world of data analytics. It may suit an accomplished post graduate looking for their first step on the Analytics ladder, and could also act as a perfect stepping stone for more experienced producers and researchers who are looking to bridge their careers into the Data Analytics industry.

Responsibilities:
Researching, Analysing and validating both structured and unstructured data sets (including public external sources and SSON’s proprietary global data sets from multiple channels )
Project managing the design, creation and upgrade of interactive research tools inside SSON Analytics website (e.g. City Cube, Intelligent Automation Universe)

Conducting independent online research
Engaging and interviewing both buy and sell side industry leaders (both f2f and telephone) to source/confirm/identify data sets
Working closely with internal cross functional team (data science, web development, marketing, events teams)
Requirements

The ideal candidate will:

About you and how you can excel in this role

You are passionate about metals and mining, and you are developing an in-depth understanding of the sector.

Your experience includes working in a commercial research team, ideally in a metals and/or mining discipline.

You are comfortable collecting and interpreting data, articulating your findings in a clear and insightful manner. This is particularly relevant when articulating your understanding of the dynamics of copper demand and its drivers. You also have a flair for writing and communication with strong presentation skills.

Your long-term aspiration is to be an influential subject matter expert setting the industry agenda.

About the role

As part of a world-class team of industry experts, you will quickly become adept at enhancing our research and market intelligence on the demand for copper. You will closely monitor and assess key developments in the copper industry with a focus on the drivers of both first and end-use demand. You will work in a small team that will take advantage of your knowledge of the sphere of copper demand but will challenge you to be involved in all aspects of the copper market. You will need to be efficient and self-motivated as well as being able to work well within the team and with other commodity groups. You will efficiently develop research data and also develop opinions and draw out conclusions from that data.

Your responsibilities will include:

- conducting desk-based analysis on actual and forecast consumption of refined copper and direct use of scrap

- contributing towards the enhancement of existing research and to the development of the drivers impacting metals and copper specifically

- compiling, manipulating and evaluating data

- reconciling data on both first and end-use demand from a variety of sources and incorporating this into Wood Mackenzie’s proprietary systems

- establishing and maintaining contacts with copper industry stakeholders to exchange views

- explaining and communicating our analysis to clients via written reports and through presentations as well as fielding ad hoc requests from both external clients and our internal consultancy in this business area

You will work effectively with and have the opportunity to learn from senior experts and the wider metals and mining team to deliver content and commercial agendas in line with product strategy. This will be used to produce high-quality research in the form of industry-defining data, thought-provoking written analysis and presentations.

Through your research and responding to client queries, you will strengthen your network of contacts at key companies and bodies. Your contribution to our industry-leading written reports, economic models and presentations will be valued. You will get the opportunity to travel.

GovTech's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence team uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore. We build software for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.

Data scientists in GovTech help crack challenging problems through the use of machine learning and other computational methods on government data. You would have the opportunity to work across domains like citizen engagement, healthcare, transport and operations.

As a data scientist, you will help to:
Improve public service delivery and policy by extracting insights from government data

Work closely with product managers, data scientists and engineers to develop, test and deploy new data products

Write production-quality code and work with engineers to put models into operation

Learn new things and impart knowledge with other team members in a multi-disciplinary team

Additionally, more senior data scientists will be expected to establish best practices, share your expertise and mentor other data scientists and help with recruiting.

Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.

Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having opinions on what is being done and having ideas on what should be done next. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.

Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.

We also develop the Smart Nation infrastructure and applications, and facilitate collaboration with citizens and businesses to co-develop technologies.

GovTech's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence team uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore. We build software for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.

Data scientists in GovTech help crack challenging problems through the use of machine learning and other computational methods on government data. You would have the opportunity to work across domains like citizen engagement, healthcare, transport and operations.

Join us as we support Singapore’s vision of building a Smart Nation - a nation of possibilities empowered through info-communications technology and related engineering.

What to Expect:
As a data scientist, you will help to:
Improve public service delivery and policy by extracting insights from government data

Work closely with product managers, data scientists and engineers to develop, test and deploy new data products

Write production-quality code and work with engineers to put models into operation

Learn new things and impart knowledge with other team members in a multi-disciplinary team

Additionally, more senior data scientists will be expected to establish best practices, share your expertise and mentor other data scientists and help with recruiting.

This job entails bringing your expertise and capability to the public sector - from coding new systems from scratch to using the best solutions the community has to offer. We use cloud services, open source software, and commodity hardware as far as possible. Knowing what to build and what to reuse lets us avoid wasting time on solved problems and focus on delivering actual value.

In GovTech, there will be opportunities to work on meaningful projects that solve problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people’s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government. If hired, expect the following:

Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.

Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having opinions on what is being done and having ideas on what should be done next. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.

Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.
