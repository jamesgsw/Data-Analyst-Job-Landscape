We also develop the Smart Nation infrastructure and applications, and facilitate collaboration with citizens and businesses to co-develop technologies.

GovTech's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence team uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore. We build software for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.

Data scientists in GovTech help crack challenging problems through the use of machine learning and other computational methods on government data. You would have the opportunity to work across domains like citizen engagement, healthcare, transport and operations.

Join us as we support Singapore’s vision of building a Smart Nation - a nation of possibilities empowered through info-communications technology and related engineering.

What to Expect:

As a data scientist, you will help to:
Improve public service delivery and policy by extracting insights from government data
Work closely with product managers, data scientists and engineers to develop, test and deploy new data products
Write production-quality code and work with engineers to put models into operation
Learn new things and impart knowledge with other team members in a multi-disciplinary team

In GovTech, there will be opportunities to work on meaningful projects that solve problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people’s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government. If hired, expect the following:
Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.
Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having opinions on what is being done and having ideas on what should be done next. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.
Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.

Title of project: Virtual metrology modelling based on image data from wafer inspection systems

Description: In semiconductor manufacturing virtual metrology refers to methods to predict the properties of a wafer based on machine parameters and sensor data in the production equipment, without performing the (costly) physical measurement of the wafer properties. Water inspection systems (WIS) are installed in many of the latest semiconductor equipment and these are used to capture high resolution images of wafers after various process steps. This image data is relatively inexpensive and available for all wafers as opposed to conventional metrology and can be used to predict physical measurements. In this project you will build machine learning models to predict metrology data using wis image data.

Scope: Collaborate with experienced process control engineers and process owners to understand specific process control and monitoring requirements that can be met by virtual metrology. Learn and apply latest machine learning/deep learning techniques to build robust predictive models.

Deliverable: Create a framework to build, score and maintain repeatable WIS based Virtual metrology models. Deploy a Virtual metrology model for production use.

302,"Research Engineer, SMART CAMP - 3D Cell Culture","SMART CAMP (Critical Analytics for Manufacturing Personalized-Medicine) is a new interdisciplinary research programme in Singapore (CREATE international research campus and innovation hub) and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). SMART CAMP addresses key technology bottlenecks in cell therapy manufacturing: (i) critical quality attributes of safe, effective cell therapy products; and (ii) integrated process analytics to monitor and modulate those attributes. While cell therapies are poised to transform healthcare for both the industry and the patient, there remain many outstanding scientific and technical challenges to significant global impact that this R&D programme addresses. This high-impact focus includes measurement and feedback control of processing parameters (process analytic technologies, or PAT) that contribute to cell viability and function during cell proliferation, and the measurement at intermediate and final steps of the cell product properties correlated with positive therapeutic outcomes (critical quality attributes, or CQA).

This interdisciplinary team comprises engineers, biologists, clinicians, manufacturing, and data analytics experts from multiple MIT academic units, and multiple Singapore-based universities, research centres of excellence, and hospitals who are experienced at translational demonstrations of technologies in safety-regulated industries such as cell therapies. As with all postdoctoral associates (PDAs) in SMART CAMP based in Singapore, the PDA will work in a diverse team of experts including several principal investigators (PIs) and PDAs, and receive direct mentorship regarding career development from a pair of who are based in Singapore and at MIT, respectively.

CAMP’s unique, enabling and cross-cutting capabilities include cell and clinical biology, microfluidics, real-time optics and spectroscopies, 3D-printed devices, process analytics, data analytics, and bioinformatics. This programme will demonstrate these approaches required of cell-based personalized medicine through three translational testbeds (three Flagship Projects), ultimately facilitating access for more patients to life-saving, approved cell therapies for currently intractable health challenges. These flagship projects will address allogeneic and autologous cell therapy products, including but not limited to cell sources including adult stem/progenitor cells and immune cells for treatment of specific cancers, tissue degeneration, and autoimmune diseases.

Flagship Project 1: Label-free critical quality attributes (CQA) for personalized efficacy of cell therapies, including multivariate analysis of biological and biophysical attributes

Flagship Project 2: Rapid critical quality attributes (CQA) for safety of cell sources & cell therapy products, including process analytic technologies (PAT)

Flagship Project 3: Integrated process analytic technologies (PAT) for cell proliferation and recovery, including in-line and intermittent monitoring to promote efficacy and safety CQA

Responsibilities

3D cell culture in understanding vasculostabilization

A key approach to predicting critical quality attributes (CQA) and corresponding mechanisms of action for cell therapy products is the development of 3D cell culture systems. In particular, the effects of secretomes for the stabilization of vascular networks can be tested in 3D cell culture systems which are more physiologically representative. The RA will focus on fabricating 3D microfluidic devices, culturing of endothelial cells and potentially other cell types, and testing of secreted compounds on stabilizing vascular networks. The job duties include:

Primary responsibility for all aspects of mammalian cell culture, including media and buffer preparation, culture initiation, propagation, and cryopreservation of cells, including primary human cells from commercial and/or patient sources as well as adherence to quality control schedules for ensuring consistency of cell culture materials.
Perform molecular biology techniques such as RNAi, pharmacology on cells, basic laboratory protocol studies, including basic calculations and data analysis.
Accurate and reliable record keeping including database management, batch records, notebooks, and all pertinent documentation.
Sterile preparation of laboratory glassware, tools, and reagents.

366,"Research Engineer / Senior Research Engineer, SMART CAMP - Cell Culture Platform and Instrumentation: Instrumented T-flasks","SMART CAMP (Critical Analytics for Manufacturing Personalized-Medicine) is a new interdisciplinary research programme in Singapore (CREATE international research campus and innovation hub) and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). SMART CAMP addresses key technology bottlenecks in cell therapy manufacturing: (i) critical quality attributes of safe, effective cell therapy products; and (ii) integrated process analytics to monitor and modulate those attributes. While cell therapies are poised to transform healthcare for both the industry and the patient, there remain many outstanding scientific and technical challenges to significant global impact that this R&D programme addresses. This high-impact focus includes measurement and feedback control of processing parameters (process analytic technologies, or PAT) that contribute to cell viability and function during cell proliferation, and the measurement at intermediate and final steps of the cell product properties correlated with positive therapeutic outcomes (critical quality attributes, or CQA).

This interdisciplinary team comprises engineers, biologists, clinicians, manufacturing, and data analytics experts from multiple MIT academic units, and multiple Singapore-based universities, research centres of excellence, and hospitals who are experienced at translational demonstrations of technologies in safety-regulated industries such as cell therapies. As with all postdoctoral associates (PDAs) in SMART CAMP based in Singapore, the PDA will work in a diverse team of experts including several principal investigators (PIs) and PDAs, and receive direct mentorship regarding career development from a pair of who are based in Singapore and at MIT, respectively.

CAMP’s unique, enabling and cross-cutting capabilities include cell and clinical biology, microfluidics, real-time optics and spectroscopies, 3D-printed devices, process analytics, data analytics, and bioinformatics. This programme will demonstrate these approaches required of cell-based personalized medicine through three translational testbeds (three Flagship Projects), ultimately facilitating access for more patients to life-saving, approved cell therapies for currently intractable health challenges. These flagship projects will address allogeneic and autologous cell therapy products, including but not limited to cell sources including adult stem/progenitor cells and immune cells for treatment of specific cancers, tissue degeneration, and autoimmune diseases.

Flagship Project 1: Label-free critical quality attributes (CQA) for personalized efficacy of cell therapies, including multivariate analysis of biological and biophysical attributes

Flagship Project 2: Rapid critical quality attributes (CQA) for safety of cell sources & cell therapy products, including process analytic technologies (PAT)

Flagship Project 3: Integrated process analytic technologies (PAT) for cell proliferation and recovery, including in-line and intermittent monitoring to promote efficacy and safety CQA

We also develop the Smart Nation infrastructure and applications, and facilitate collaboration with citizens and businesses to co-develop technologies.

GovTech's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence team uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore. We build software for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.

Data scientists in GovTech help crack challenging problems through the use of machine learning and other computational methods on government data. You would have the opportunity to work across domains like citizen engagement, healthcare, transport and operations.

Join us as we support Singapore’s vision of building a Smart Nation - a nation of possibilities empowered through info-communications technology and related engineering.

What to Expect:
As a data scientist, you will help to:
Improve public service delivery and policy by extracting insights from government data

Work closely with product managers, data scientists and engineers to develop, test and deploy new data products

Write production-quality code and work with engineers to put models into operation

Learn new things and impart knowledge with other team members in a multi-disciplinary team

Additionally, more senior data scientists will be expected to establish best practices, share your expertise and mentor other data scientists and help with recruiting.

This job entails bringing your expertise and capability to the public sector - from coding new systems from scratch to using the best solutions the community has to offer. We use cloud services, open source software, and commodity hardware as far as possible. Knowing what to build and what to reuse lets us avoid wasting time on solved problems and focus on delivering actual value.

In GovTech, there will be opportunities to work on meaningful projects that solve problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people’s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government. If hired, expect the following:

Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.

Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having opinions on what is being done and having ideas on what should be done next. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.

Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.

GuardRails provides continuous security feedback that empowers developers to find, fix, and prevent vulnerabilities and enables teams to create web and mobile applications securely, without needing external expertise.

As GuardRails continues to grow, we are building a team of security engineers that have the autonomy to improve the security engines and security scanning technologies of our platform. Any improvement and new feature that is added to our platform is immediately available to thousands of businesses around the globe.

At GuardRails we are establishing a truly distributed team and as such, besides the technical requirements below, we are looking for people that are proactive, with excellent communication skills and the ability to work on tasks independently.

About you


As a security engineer, you play a critical role in directly influencing the quality of the GuardRails security scanning platform as well as ensuring it's security and the security of our thousands of users and customers.

You are a highly motivated, analytically driven security expert who understands all flavors of software development lifecycles as well as modern DevOps approaches and cloud infrastructure. Although you have experience as a penetration tester and/or bug bounty hunter, you don't like the inefficiencies of identifying vulnerabilities at the end of the lifecycle, in production, but would rather empower developers to find, fix and prevent vulnerabilities when they are being introduced into the code base.

You have 5+ years of experience in security testing and securing production-level web applications, including:
Great security engineering experience across the board with a strong knowledge in at least three programming languages
Practical experience with securing containers
Practical experience with securing cloud environments such as AWS or GCP
Ability to rapidly apply your existing knowledge in new domains and new technologies
Knowing the difference between relevant security vulnerabilities and noise
Ability to determine false positives and codifying patterns to avoid them
If you have some of these skills, even better:
Worked as security engineer in software development teams
Experience with CI/CD for production environments.
Experience with agile software development methodologies like Kanban or Scrum
Responsibilities


The high-level categories are:
Managing the security engines
Making sure they are up-to-date, revisiting the rule curation, writing new rules, tuning false positives. Writing new engines for other programming languages (essentially wrappers for open source tools). But this will also cover new scanning techniques such as DAST, Container scans, infrastructure scans and cloud platform scans.
Performing security tests
Against GuardRails on the source code, runtime, and infrastructure level and make sure that issues will be detected by GuardRails in the future (where possible). Your OSCP will come in handy here.
Research & Development
Support the machine learning initiative, research new ways how GuardRails can be improved, and share your learnings from 1/2/3 in blog posts, white papers, and other ways.
Your duties include the following:
Perform penetration tests, code review, threat modelling of the entire GuardRails infrastructure and actively help making it secure.
Manage all security testing engines and ensure they are continuously updated and improved (new rules, lower false positives). This includes supporting the addition of new scanning technologies (Docker scanning, DAST, Runtime monitoring, cloud infra security, CI/ CD security, security requirements etc)
Help visualize security data for different stakeholders (CEO, CISO, VP Engineering, etc. ) via our dashboard. Support interview of stakeholders (reddit, users, customers, ...) about metrics and insights they would like to see.
Participate in research of applied machine learning to find vulnerabilities, identify fixes and suggest auto fixes.
May include figuring out how to do create auto exploits that result in automated tests for vulnerabilities.
Create white-papers, blog posts, and other resources to share GuardRails cutting edge technology and your research findings.
Regular management reporting of product status
Ensure all documentation relating to your product contributions are up-to-date
Support hiring and interview processes
