446,2020 Intern - Smart Manufacturing & AI Data Science,"Req. ID: 140861

The intern will be working on exploring rules to automate the adaptivity of a fingerprint based monitoring system that has been set up on photolithography sensor data. Some of the possible requirements include detection if the fingerprints are becoming obsolete over time, treatments to make the training set cleaner from noise and potential labeling of root causes of fingerprint drifts over time to build up a knowledge base system.

A prototype fingerprint based litho process monitoring system has been built with a domain expert guided manual/semi-automated process for setup training and monitoring. In the next phase, the intention is to make the whole system more adaptive with minimal manual intervention needs. The intern will need to research and apply computer science + statistics knowledge to code rules that can be used for this goal in terms of detecting which fingerprints have become less important over time etc. Through this project, the intern will learn about the different challenges related with having a static “model” in a rapidly changing environment like that in a manufacturing sector and the different approaches that can be taken to have a more dynamic “model” or system.

632,#SGUNITEDJOBS GLOBAL DATA ANALYST,"Position Purpose & Summary:
The volume of analytical data that our businesses and analysts are generating is increasing significantly, as is the breadth and frequency with which public data and market data is made available. Proprietary data streams exist in disparate sources, hindering the analytics process.

Although the business unit has started to adopt best practices regarding centralised, integrated, scalable data systems and analytical tools, we teams are still learning how to leverage these capabilities for both familiar and new trading opportunities. This situation creates data loss concerns as well as makes it very difficult for others in the department to utilise that data.

The ideal candidate will need to understand how data adds value to our analysts and our trading teams, be able to engage our offices around the world to find that data and demonstrate the value of it. The candidate will work with the Trading Analytics Technology Team (TAT) to harvest, secure, and share the data, and understand how to leverage it with a common set of integrated tools.

656,Research Scientist in Artificial Intelligence Education Centre (OER) [NIE],"Overview

The Office of Education Research (OER) of the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore, encompass 5 programme research areas in:

Cognitive, Emotional and Social Learning (CESD)
Lifelong Learning, Cognition and Wellbeing (LLCW)
Learning Sciences & Innovation (LS&I)
Schools, Leadership and System Studies (SLSS)
Teacher Professionalism and Learning (TPAL)

Since 1 April 2008, the Office of Education Research (OER) has led efforts to spearhead programmes grounded in the principles of advancing research, development and innovation at NIE. The Office is committed to providing the resources and support systems – through the governance, monitoring, quality assurance and dissemination of education research – that will produce high-quality education research with impact on policy and practice.

NIE’s research is guided by the Research and Development Framework – a policy-driven, evidence-based framework that guides academic and research staff to improve the quality of teaching and learning in Singapore schools and to build on NIE's standing as a leading international research institution.

The Office aims to conduct rigorous, relevant multidisciplinary research and development that inform policy, pedagogy and practice in Singapore and internationally. With a strong focus on advancing knowledge in the 5 priority areas above, the Office provides researchers with valuable research opportunities and platforms to enhance their global academic profile.

The Office is looking for Research Scientists to join their research efforts in the strategic university area in Artificial Intelligence Education (AIED).

Today, we are all operating in a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) supported world. To be effective and successful in this kind of world, we need to develop the competencies, skills and dispositions to learn, relearn and unlearn in response to the changes in the workplace. To remain competitive in a VUCA world, the Singapore Government has initiated the skillsfuture movement to ensure that the “skills, passion and contributions of every individual will drive Singapore's next phase of development towards an advanced economy and inclusive society”. Skillsfuture for educators requires teachers to be literate with AI and its advancements and to consider how such emerging technologies can be embraced in the teaching and learning praxis.

NIE/NTU is a premier institution with strong roots in education and has more recently developed a wealth of research-practice nexus understandings on learning and learners’ cognition and emotion with the NTU schools such in medicine and the humanities. Hence, AI and Science of Learning (SoL) should co-inform each other. With NIE’s wealth of knowledge in evidence-based practices that are contextualised, effective and scalable for adoption in K-12 schools, it can potentially scale up AI and SoL research in education interventions. The role of research is thus to provide the evidence that guides the practice and, more importantly, to allow the practice to extend into new contexts.

We are interested in candidates with expertise in AI literacy, learning through/with AI supported or enabled technologies (e.g., intelligent tutoring systems, learning analytics, educational data mining, and etc) and AI enabled assessments and analytics.

Candidates with appropriate qualifications and relevant research experience are encouraged to apply. Successful candidates will work with a team of driven researchers in diverse areas related to AIED.

In addition, the Office provides Research Scientists with valuable research opportunities and the platform to enhance their global academic profile.
